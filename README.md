Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease with significant health implications. Early detection and accurate predictions can assist in timely medical interventions. This project aims to:

Explore the dataset and identify key health indicators.
Train machine learning models to predict diabetes.
Evaluate the models and save the best-performing one.

Target Variable: Diabetes (Yes/No).
Features:
Demographics: Age, Gender.
Health Metrics: Height, Weight, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol.
